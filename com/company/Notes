get() vs navigate()
-- navigate can go back, forward and refresh page
-- get() will wait for the page fully load whereas navigate() wont
-- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

close() vs quit()

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see the control panel (back, forward etc)
-- fullscreen() will maximize the whole web page
