What is a webElement?
Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a web element
e.g buttons, text boxes checkboxes, links

HTML?
Hyper Text Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM Stand for for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
internal view of the webpage
Also called as Developer's tools or dev tools
Document ==> a simple html document which represent the page we are inspecting
Object ==> any line in HTML is considered to be an Object
Model ==> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
Is an address or a position of a web element on the webpage
is used to locate or identify web elements on the webpage

8 locators in Selenium:
ID
Name
TagName
xpath
LinkText
PartialLinkText
CssSelectors
ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators fo all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicates values and notes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for e.g
linktext and partial linktext are only used for links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

if two or more elements have more attributes and attributes values
selenium will only interact the first one
