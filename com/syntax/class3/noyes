Why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?
    Developers may not provide all the locators in HTML
    By using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
    Is a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath:
    Absolute Xpath --> starts from the starting node of the html
                       it always starts with single slash (/)
                       search /html/body/div/div/div

    Relative Xpath --> starts from any node in html
                       it always starts with double slash (//)

Syntax for relative xpath:
    //tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value'] // we need @ only for attributes
    //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:
    //tagname[text() = 'text value']
    //a[text() = 'Create new account']
    //h2[text() = 'Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.'] // for text fe don't use @

Identifying elements by using contains method:
    //tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
    //input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]
    //h2[contains(text(),'the world')] - text

starts-with will identify elements by its partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attributes,'partial starting attribute value')]
//input[starts-with(@aria-label,'Email')]

Advanced Xpath:
    Is based on parent and child, sibling relationships

Identifying by following siblings:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::tagname
//input[@id='calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

Identifying elements by preceding sibling:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::tagname
//span[text() = '& Order')]/preceding-sibling::span

Identifying elements by its parent:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent-sibling::parentTagname
//span[text() = '& Order')]/parent::a

Identifying elements by uts ancestors:
//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying elements by its index:
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
